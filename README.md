## notes

* print %q for letters
* print %T for variable type
* the same package name in more than 1 file - you can refer to functions directly
* Capital letters functions against lowercase one (non exported)
* {} braces, [] brackets () parens
* declare a function with PARAMETER, run the function with ARGUMENT
* type and UNTYPED constants
* pointers:
** x := 5           // assign value that goes to a memory address
** fmt.Println(&x)  // print this ipaddress_primary
** var z *int = &x  // assign mem address to z (which is of type "int pointer")
** fmt.Println(*b)  // dereferencing (showing value not mem address again)
** for init; condition; post { }
